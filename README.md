# Keras and Tensorflow
These are a set of programs using Tensorflow and Keras which will simplify the basic concepts of machine learning.

## Predict y coordinate given x coordinate using linear regression
The goal of this program is to predict the y coordinate when x coordinate is given as input. The system learns from a set sample with x and y data values related by y=mx+c.
